/// This exists because iOS gives a third-party app no way to run a background timer — you
/// cannot say "call me in 10 minutes". DeviceActivity's callbacks are the only mechanism.
///
/// It does **not** re-apply the shield itself. A block appearing mid-scroll with no warning
/// was unpleasant, so expiry only records that the break is over and alerts; the user then
/// picks "Start Work" or "New Break" from the Live Activity.
///
/// Note the extension cannot touch the Live Activity: measured on device,
/// `Activity.activities` is empty here, so any update or end call is a silent no-op. The
/// widget's own `staleDate` handling covers the visual change instead.
